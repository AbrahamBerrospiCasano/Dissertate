LaTeX template for a Harvard Dissertation
===============

This package provides all the files needed to support the production and typesetting of a PhD dissertation at Harvard. The format and styling is based closely on GSAS's document *Form of the PhD dissertation* (http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/images/stories/pdfs/form%20of%20dissertation.pdf). Contributions and bug reports should be made on Github using pull requests and issues.

Basic installation instructions
============

### Windows XP ###

1. Download basic-miktex-2.9.4244.exe  http://miktex.org/
2. Download SumatraPDF v 1.5.1 http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html
3. Download this Git Repo
4. Copy the contents of `fonts\` into
`C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\fonts\opentype\public\ArnoPro`
5. To complie, from the MSYS command prompt run:
`xelatex -synctex=-1 thesis.tex`


### Mac OS X ###

1. Downlaod MacTex (http://tug.org/mactex/). It's big, roughly 2 GB.
2. To compile, from the terminal (e.g., Terminal.app) run: `xelatex thesis`

Install whatever fonts you'll be using in the usual way for OS X. For example, to install the included fonts, you can open the `fonts` directory, select all the font files, double click on any one of them, and then click the `Install font` button on the Font Book window that appears.

### Ubuntu ###

1. Install xetex: `sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex`
2. Copy the fonts (from the template folder): `sudo cp fonts/*/usr/local/share/fonts/`
3. Add `\aliasfontfeatureoption{Ligatures}{Historic}{Historical}` in harvard-thesis.cls just above the \setromanfont... command. This is because the syntax changed at some point from "Historical" to "Historic" but the Ubuntu package is obviously a little behind. See here: http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2010-September/018106.html.
4. Run `xelatex thesis.tex`.

FAQ
=============
###How do I make the text justified instead of ragged right?
Remove or comment out the line `\RaggedRight` from the .cls file.

Known Bugs
==========
There is a minor bug regarding figure captions for full page figures. Harvard requires that full page figures be preceded by a page containing only a figure caption. I have modified the fltpage package to do this. Now the bug: on rare occasions, if LaTeX has many small floats in the queue, a second float can appear on the page that is supposed to have only the figure caption. This is a known bug in the fltpage package, see for example the comments in the original (unmodified) source: http://www.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/fltpage/fltpage.dtx
